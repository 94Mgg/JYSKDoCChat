{"content": "Terms like “instruction”, “guide” and “manual” are often used interchangeably in day to day language. To avoid confusion some important terms will be defined in this chapter.\n\nWithin this JYSK standard the word “manual” refers to the physical printed document delivered with the blind and considered part of the product.\n\nJYSK requires one single manual for the blind containing all necessary information for the blind product.\n\nInside the manual must be “warnings” and “instructions” describing how to perform actions related to the product throughout the product lifecycle.\n\nWarnings and instructions both refer to information (texts and illustrations) printed inside the manual. Warnings in most cases concern how to avoid dangerous situations while instructions concern how to correctly perform actions related to the blind.\n\nTo secure that all necessary information is in place for the end-customer, manuals for JYSK must be defined and described in “sections” each containing specific information. Requirements for each section are elaborated within the separate chapters of this standard. The use of sections stems from the idea that every manual must present information in the same order to give a uniform user experience no matter the product.\n\nThe use of sections follows a contingency approach meaning that only relevant sections should be included in the\n\nSections that are not relevant for a specific blind should naturally be omitted.\n\nAcceptance by JYSK is a prerequisite to omitting any section.\n\nA JYSK blind manual must when relevant contain the following sections:\n\n1.
