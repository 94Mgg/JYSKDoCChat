{"content": "To achieve the highest possible degree of satisfaction amongst customers who have been so unfortunate to buy a product with defects customer claims must be given high priority, so the quality problems are solved as quickly as possible.\n\nJYSK operates with two different claim procedures, which in general describe how our suppliers should act during the claim process. All customer claims in stores and online are registered in JYSK claim system. The reason for the actual claim will be registered and pictures can be uploaded. If major quality issues occur all information from the JYSK claim system can be passed on to the actual supplier. JYSK is not able to provide suppliers with further information and suppliers must accept this.\n\nThe two claim procedures in JYSK claim system:\n\n• Claim procedure 1 applies as a rule for goods invoiced from local suppliers, but also some non-local suppliers can be “Claim procedure 1 supplier” see 3.1.1.\n\n• Claim procedure 2 applies as a rule for goods invoiced from all non-local suppliers. Claim procedure 2 can also be applied for low cost goods see 3.1.2.\n\nThe claim procedure must be agreed with the Category Manager and JYSK C&Q and be stated in the Supplier Creation process in SAP.\n\nAll claims are sent directly from the stores to the supplier by e-mail. This is done by using JYSK claim system. Claims must be settled by the supplier in the following prioritized order:\n\n1.

The customer receives a discount as compensation.\n\n3. The customer receives a replacement product.\n\n1. When ordering spare parts, the stores will forward a \"Spare part order\" form. The \"Spare part order\" form can only be used to ordering spare parts and cannot replace the \"complain note\" Our suppliers must be able to dispatch spare parts directly to the stores or to the customers (decided by the store) no later than the 1st working day after supplier has received a \"Spare part order\" form from one of JYSK`s stores. When it is not possible to dispatch on the 1st weekday, the supplier must forward a written confirmation within the same period of time notifying the delivery date, so that the store can give the customer qualified information.\n\n2. A reduction of up to 25% can be granted without the supplier's prior approval. The supplier must approve if there is a need for any additional reduction. If the supplier does not react within 14 days from the date of issue of the claim form, the proposed reduction is considered as accepted.\n\nThe solution chosen is noted on the \"complain note\"' and forwarded to the supplier indicating that the claim has been completed vis-à-vis the customer. The claim form will subsequently form the basis of the amount that will be deducted from the next payment", "page": 13, "source": "JYSK 8003 - Product quality deviations and customer claims.pdf", "type": "MergedText"}

When a product is to be exchanged into a new product, the store must forward a claim form indicating 100% repayment, and the payment will be deducted from the next payment as mentioned above. The supplier should not send any substitute product.\n\nIf a claim form cannot be settled by making a deduction from future payments, but instead by the supplier forwarding a cheque for the amount, this settlement must be carried out directly to the financial department in the respective country. Settlement must be done within one month from issue of claim form. Any freight costs for picking up/delivering products subject to a lawful claim must also be noted on the \"complain note\" form. The supplier must prepare on-going statistics covering the numbers and sources of claims.
