{"content": "Furniture supplied to JYSK must have sturdy surfaces reflecting reliable product quality. Valid assessment of mechanical surface properties is a highly technical topic and quite complex as it is difficult to perfectly simulate the effects of real-life use in a testing environment.\n\nJYSK evaluates mechanical surface properties on the following testable parameters:\n\n• Resistance to scratching\n\n• Resistance to impact\n\n• Adhesion\n\nJYSK states specific requirements for each of the parameters using standardized test methods. When setting requirements JYSK distinguish between different surface categories and classes as mechanical properties vary greatly depending on the combination of materials used.\n\nStated requirements are in all cases minimum requirement that may be exceeded.\n\nJYSK reserves the right to test that mechanical properties do not significantly differentiate between product samples and final products using the stated tests – significant differences between samples and actual products are naturally unacceptable even though meeting the minimum requirements.\n\nIn some cases parts or areas on products cannot be tested in accordance with the designated test methods due to size or shape - In these cases the supplier must at request supply JYSK with a suitable sample of identical material composition.\n\nThe following terms apply in relation to mechanical properties:\n\nA substrate is the underlying material (core layer) of a furniture product. An example of a substrate could be the MDF in a laminated board.\n\nA surface coating is a material in liquid, pasty, powder or vapor form applied to the surface of a furniture product.

Note that coverings often consist of several layers and materials but are always addressed as one single layer in this context.\n\nExamples: Decorative papers, melamine or high-pressure laminates.\n\nHardwood is wood from angiosperm trees. Examples of hardwoods are ash, birch, elm and oak. JYSK operates with higher requirements for hardwoods than for softwoods even though some hardwoods are softer than hard softwoods.\n\nBamboo is considered a hardwood even though technically not within the definition.\n\nSoftwood is wood from gymnosperm trees.

{"content": "Scratch resistance is the ability of surfaces to withstand perpendicular application of forces in the direction of the surface. The scratch resistance highly coincides with the hardness of the surface material but also depend on parameters such as friction, roughness, elastic spring-back and visual appearance.\n\nThe objective of the test is to find the minimum load producing a continuous visible scratch mark. The load is applied with a motor driven turntable apparatus on a hemispherical diamond scratching-tip of specific geometry.\n\nThe visibility of created scratches is evaluated under a certain light source within a viewing cabinet. The final result is the average of three samples.\n\nTwo additional categories exist in relation to scratch resistance requirements:\n\nA specific category exists for high gloss surfaces as they are very vulnerable to scratches. Test requirements for the high gloss category apply to all high gloss surfaces (horizontal or vertical) independently of material or function of the surface.\n\nSome surfaces must be more scratch resistant due to high scratch exposure.\n\nSurfaces within the exposed surface category include the following:\n\nTabletops (e.g. dinner-, office-, coffee-, end- and bed-side tables)\n\nTop surfaces on storage furniture with a height less than 160 cm.\n\nUpwards facing surfaces in open storage furniture (e.g. book cases and room dividers).\n\n• Seats\n\nExposed surface requirements apply only when the material based requirement is lower.\n\nThe exposed surface requirement does not apply for surfaces of unprotected softwood.", "page": 21, "source": "JYSK 4003 - Surfaces.pdf", "type": "MergedText"}
