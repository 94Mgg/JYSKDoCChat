Ensuring that customers have access to environmentally responsible options.\n\nThere is increasing requirements regarding sustainability and recyclability of products and materials as well as using fewer virgin materials, from both consumers and legislative organizations because of the greater focus on product sustainability.\n\nThere are different aspects to this hereunder durability, the product’s lifetime vs the recycled part of the materials, re", "page": 3, "source": "JYSK 8007 - Product sustainability.pdf", "type": "OCRText"}

The full picture of the products lifetime and reusability after use is also to take in consideration.\n\nWhen recycled materials have a higher emission than virgin materials, there must be consideration of the environmental impact of using new materials as well. New materials also consume the earth's resources and may affect biodiversity, water quality, soil health, and other ecological factors.\n\nJYSK does not accept lowering the quality of the product to be able to use more recycled materials. They must comply with standards, certificates, and ensure that the product has a long and durable lifespan as a product made of virgin materials or being with significant lover emission compared to other products in comparable lifetime spans.\n\nJYSK requires a recycled material to be certified by a third-party validation scheme see 3 to ensure traceability and proof of claim/statement and to avoid green washing.\n\nTargets for JYSK products containing or to be fully of recycled materials can be both an internal JYSK target or a target set by an outside organization e.g. the European Union.\n\nJYSK will continuously set new internal targets to achieve outside set targets and internal targets.\n\nJYSK suppliers and their producers must actively participate in supporting JYSK to achieve these targets as the cooperating for incorporating recycled materials into both existing and new products is crucial to succeed in reaching the targets.\n\nJYSK welcomes and encourage any innovative ideas or initiatives that can contribute to reaching the targets.\n\n| Target type", "page": 4, "source": "JYSK 8007 - Product sustainability.pdf", "type": "OCRText"}

{"content": "The Material Matrix Table 5 is a tool for JYSK purchasing to use when making decisions about materials. It is aligned with JYSK’s material requirements and strategy described here in JYSK 8007-Product Sustainability.\n\nThe material matrix allows for comparison of different versions of materials or material categories, such as cellulose fibres, wood, and cotton. The comparison is divided in four levels: A, B, C, and D, which show prohibited materials, minimum requirements, and the goals within the material family.\n\nLevel C is the minimum requirement for the material category. This indicates the lowest standard for the material category we wish to have in our assortment. Levels B and A are the better options we are working towards. D level indicates the prohibited materials within the material category. These are the materials we do not allow in our assortment.\n\nIf the material versions are the same for multiple materials under the same material category; those materials are grouped into that category and not mentioned separately (e.g. polyester, polyether, and polypropylene are all grouped under plastics).\n\nWorking with material choices is an ongoing process that requires a continuous approach, why we will regularly assess the material matrix, and the materials included. These categories and levels will be updated whenever new information or data becomes available.\n\nCurrently, JYSK is focused on Better Cotton Initiative, and at this moment, we do not have sufficient data indicating whether organic cotton is better than Better Cotton.
