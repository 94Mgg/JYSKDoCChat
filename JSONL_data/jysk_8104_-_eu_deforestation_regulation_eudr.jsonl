{"content": "This Standard Operation Procedure describes JYSK’s requirements on how to exercise due diligence according to the (EU) 2023/1115 EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and products/commodities related to deforestation. The seven commodities include cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy, and wood as defined in Annex I of EUDR.\n\nEUDR does not apply to timber harvested before 29th of June 2023. The EU Commission is working on exemption codes, which must be declared before import of goods.\n\nIf the product is subject to EUTR, suppliers need to follow the JYSK 8101 SOP, if the timber is harvested before 29th of June 2023 no geolocation is required.\n\nRequirements described within this SOP will be effective from 1st of October 2024, replacing the existing JYSK 8101 - Timber Regulation SOP. JYSK 10001, JYSK 10002 and JYSK 10003 will be replaced by JYSK 10005, JYSK 10006 and JYSK 10007 from this SOP.\n\nThis procedure will be updated frequently before EUDR enters into force. The SOP can be subject to changes, due to the development of the EU Commission’s Information System or other requirements/guidelines that will be continuously updated.\n\n| Section      | Changes                         |   Unnamed: 2 |\n|:-------------|:", "page": 1, "source": "JYSK 8104 - EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).pdf", "type": "MergedText"}

Therefore, JYSK requires EUDR suppliers to make polygons instead of points no matter the size of plot.\n\nPolygons can for example be created by drawing lines in My Maps (Google) or using geojson.io.

{"content": "Clarification of ‘ascertaining' that due diligence has been carried out, so that large companies downstream benefit from simplified obligations (a minimal legal obligation of collecting reference numbers of Due Diligence Statement (DDS) from their suppliers and using those references for their own DDS submissions now applies).\n\nThe above passage from the updated EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) refers to a clarification in due diligence responsibilities, particularly aimed at large downstream companies (i.e., companies that are further along in the supply chain, like importers, processors, or retailers).\n\nIt is important to note that if an upstream supplier refuses to share geolocation coordinates (directly or via a DDS), JYSK as their downstream buyer may not be able to legally place the product on the EU market, because JYSK cannot rely on the upstream supplier’s due diligence. This may result in shipments being legally blocked from importing or selling the product in the EU. Hence JYSK rejects cooperating with upstream suppliers who refuse to share details about their supply chains. Therefore, the direct supplier to JYSK should strongly consider switching to a supplier who is willing to provide the geolocation coordinates needed.\n\nProducts with approved EUTR documents will remain valid, but additional documentation described in 3 is required.
