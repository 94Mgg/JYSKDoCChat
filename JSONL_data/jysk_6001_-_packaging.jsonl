{"content": "The aim of this standard is to clarify the requirements for the packaging and protection of JYSK goods. The packaging is necessary to protect the goods during transport, and in som cases to be the sales packing and information carrier for the product as well, and to promote the product inside. The packaging is considered as a part of the product and must be included in all prices during negotiations.\n\nThe packaging should be fit for purpose, and designed to exacting standards that fulfils the following criteria:\n\n1. Provide adequate protection, preservation and containment of the product.\n\n2. Provide convenience when handling by both our Distribution Staff and Customers alike.\n\n3. Comply with EU 94/62/ec.\n\n4. Comply with REACH requirements in General Requirements.\n\n5. Be economical commensurate with meeting all the required functions of packaging.\n\n6. Must meet the aesthetic requirements.\n\n7. Vacuum lifting requirement.\n\n8. Boxes must be stackable.\n\n9. Size of packaging must be fitted to the size of the product inside.\n\n10. Packaging materials must be separatable to mono materials and easily be able to be recycled.\n\nProducts supplied for JYSK must comply with relevant JYSK standards.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the supplier to ensure conformity. If divergent or conflicting requirements are found the supplier must immediately inform JYSK C&Q.\n\nNote: The material specifications in this standard are minimum requirements, it is always the responsibility of the supplier to ensure that the packaging and product in combination can", "page": 3, "source": "JYSK 6001 - Packaging.pdf", "type": "MergedText"}
