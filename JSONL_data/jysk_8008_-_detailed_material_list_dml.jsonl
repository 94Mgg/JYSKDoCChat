{"content": "The platform is structured to focus on parts and materials. This means we ask for data about the fabric and foam of the chair - not the whole seat consisting of these parts.\n\nTo make it easier to input data you can summarize or group materials that have the same specifications and the same place of production and country of origin. A material specification can be:\n\n• Thickness/height for flat objects (e.g., MDF, plywood, sheets, foils)\n\n• Profiles (cross-section) for elongated objects (e.g., pipes, rods, tubes)\n\n• Density and thickness/height for foams\n\nThis means for articles with the same textile appearing more than once they can be summarized if they have the same traits. Here the criteria would be the textile construction and dyeing method, gsm, and dtex.\n\nFor smaller and more insignificant parts you can exclude them from DML if you don’t have the data needed – they need to be listed below to be excluded:\n\n• Care label\n\n• Sewing thread\n\nPlease also input information on treatments, coatings, paint or similar for the parts where relevant. This should be added to the field “Additional information” that will be described later in the guide.\n\nBelow are a few examples of parts and materials to be input for different articles.\n\n| Bed Linen                          | Bed Linen.1                                         | Unnamed: 2   | Sheet                 |\n|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:-------------|:----------------------|\n| These", "page": 9, "source": "JYSK 8008 - Detailed Material List (DML).pdf", "type": "MergedText"}

{"content": "There are a few validations on the platform making sure fields that are mandatory are filled in and that the weight of the article matches the weight provided in the PIF. These validations are explained in the following sections along with how this is relevant when inputting data.\n\nThe weight of the materials and parts you input are essential as they have to match the article net weight before the data can be sent to approval with JYSK. The articles net weight is based on the input in the PIF meaning the better the weight data early in the process – the fewer corrections will have to be made when you start working in DML.\n\nThe article net weight is shown at the top of the platform next to article number. This is the weight you have to match with the data you input.\n\nFor each part you input data for including weight and quantity the platform calculates to current total.\n\nThe weight calculated in this field summarizing all the parts and materials have to match the articles net weight before sending the article data to approval with JYSK. You can save the data and work on it later, but you are not able to submit it to JYSK before this is correct.\n\nFor more information on how to input weight and what to do if it does not match the Net Weight see section 8.4.\n\nPage 10/34", "page": 10, "source": "JYSK 8008 - Detailed Material List (DML).pdf", "type": "MergedText"}

There are two situations where this applies. One is when suppliers input data into the DML and there is a small difference between input weight and the net weight you have to match. The other situation is when the article arrives at the distribution center, and we inspect and approve the article.\n\nThe purpose of allowing for correction in data by the supplier before submitting data to JYSK is to avoid minor weight differences to stop the flow.

Looking at the table above for articles between 1-5 Kg an 8% weight tolerance is allowed.\n\nBefore you can send the article for approval by JYSK the weight in Detailed Material List has to match exactly. When you are within the tolerance it means you have to correct the data to make it match. First step is of course to check if there is a mistake in the data input. After that has been done, please consider the article and materials and add extra weight where the fluctuations are likely to originate from and if that is not possible find the main materials in the article and allocate the weight between them.\n\nIf the weight you see in the Detailed material list tab for an article is wrong and it is not within the tolerance for rounding up or down according to the table above, then the future process will be to get the weight corrected.\n\nFor now and until the submit button mentioned in section 2.2 has been implemented, we ask that you save and close the article despite not matching.
